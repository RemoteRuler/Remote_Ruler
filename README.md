## Features

-   **Antigravity Physics**: A custom-built particle engine where elements float upwards and react to mouse movement with 3D parallax effects.
-   **Smart Quotes**: A database of over 300 motivational quotes that randomly refresh and never repeat until you've seen them all.
-   **Privacy First**: The pill-shaped search bar redirects securely to DuckDuckGo/Google (configurable) "Without Being Tracked".
-   **Content Protection**: The interface is "read-only" (uncopyable) to maintain the immersive experience, while keeping the search input fully functional.
-   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that looks stunning on any device.
